	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
	<h3>What is Barcamp?</h3>
	<p>A Barcamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. Saskatoon has been hosting Barcamps since 2006! The goal of Barcamp Saskatoon is to bring together people who love technology to talk, learn, and strengthen the community. This gathering is for everyone interested in technology: software developers, marketers, content creators, entrepreneurs, artists, educators, students, academics, and more!</p>
	<h3>How Much are Tickets?</h3>
	<p>Barcamp Saskatoon is FREE to attend! We ask that attendees register in advance so that we can plan appropriately. Registration will be coming soon!</p>
	<h3>Who is Speaking / What are the Sessions?</h3>
	<p>Barcamp does not have a program made in advance, it is made at the start of the event. Sessions can vary in length and format, but we recommend 20 to 25 minutes for presentations followed by an interactive question and answer session. There may be opportunities for &ldquo;Lightning Talks&rdquo; ~10 minutes or less in length if there is enough interest! If you&rsquo;d like to have a Q&amp;A or Open Discussion Session we&rsquo;re happy to facilitate that too!</p>
    <p>Session registration will be opening soon, now is the time to start thinking about what you&rsquo;d like to talk about!</p>
	<h3>Is there food or drink?</h3>
	<p>Alcoholic beverages will be available at the event as well as a free pizza supper! All of this is possible thanks to our wonderful sponsors. Please ensure that you fill out any dietary restrictions on the registration form, so that we can order pizza that everyone is able to enjoy! Please ensure that you drink responsibly and plan a safe ride home after the event.</p>
	<h3>How can I help / volunteer / sponsor?</h3>
	<p>Please spread the word to friends and colleagues via twitter, facebook, or any other channels you like. The more people at the event, the better!</p>
    <p>Everyone is expected to help out where possible. If you&rsquo;d like to show up early to help set up, or stay late to tear down, that would be great! If you&rsquo;d like a more formal role, please email kim [at] barcampsaskatoon [dot] org.</p>
    <p>Sponsorship is greatly appreciated and helps us pay for things like food, alcohol, space, equipment rental, name tags, office supplies, etc. If you would like to sponsor the event and make a monetary or other sort of contribution, please contact chris [at] barcampsaskatoon [dot] org.</p>
